## load_pipeline.R
## ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Single entry point for the Folding Beijing / "If—" / Sonnet 18 sentiment
## analysis pipeline. Sources every numbered method script in common/, in
## dependency order (00-shared_objects.R first, then 01-05), skipping the
## diagnostic checker (00-check_shared_objects.R), which is run on demand,
## never automatically.
##
## IMPORTANT: this file is intentionally NOT named with a numeric prefix
## (e.g. NOT "00-load-pipeline.R") and does NOT call load_pipeline() at its
## own bottom. Both are deliberate — either one alone would let this file
## get swept up by its own scan pattern and recurse infinitely the same way
## 00-check_shared_objects.R once did. Keep it this way.
